# Getting Started 
Thanks for your interest in DeXit Chain. In this technical documentation, we have covered node setup instructions, our all-in-one command-line interface , and different SDK modules we utilized in the DeXit Chain


## Running Node: 

This is a detailed documentation for setting up a Validator or a full node on DeXit Network. 
	
## Pre-requisites
We officially support macOS, and Linux only. Other platforms may work but there is no guarantee. We will extend our support to other platforms after we have stabilized our current architecture.


## Prepare your Node

To run DeXit nodes, you will need least with the following minimum requirements:

8-core, x86_64 architecture processor

32GB RAM 

1 TB of SSD storage space


A broadband Internet connection with up/down 10Mbps
Note: If you are running a node in Testnet, 120GB SSD, 2CPU/8GB of RAM is sufficient.
install DeXit Fullnode you can download the pre-build binaries from release page or follow the instructions to set up a full node.

Compilation
Requirements
    • Linux or Mac
    • golang >= 1.13
    • git

Download the config files genesis.json and config.toml by:
## testnet
wget --no-check-certificate  $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/DeXit-Network/Dxt/releases/latest |grep browser_ |grep testnet |cut -d\" -f4)
unzip testnet.zip
Launch your node and wait for it to get synced
Create your Private Key to setup Node account
You need to create an account that represents a validator's Account information. Use the following command to create a new account and set a password for that account:
geth account new --datadir ./node
echo {your-password} > password.txt


Warning 

Please do not expose your RPC endpoints to public network.
geth --config ./config.toml --datadir ./node --syncmode snap -unlock {your-validator-address} --password password.txt  --mine  --allow-insecure-unlock --cache 18000

Network Params
Community users can use any Ethereum compatible wallet to configure with DeXit network params, like metamask etc.

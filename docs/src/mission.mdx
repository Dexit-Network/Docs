# Mission: 

To accelerate the flow of value around the world without boundaries. 
We envision an open, borderless world. 

A world in which people and 
machines collaborate and exchange value globally and freely, without 
gatekeepers or intermediaries. A world in which communities thrive, 
unconstrained by artificial borders and archaic regulations. 
We will strive to empower everyone to effortlessly join this new, better world. 

## Risk statement
    • Before any operations in the fields related to Digital Asset or DeFi, please first do your own research.
    • All users and developers can build the dApp in DeXit testnet then the mainnet in the follow-up for free.
    • Please distinguish the test environment (the testnet) from the main network environment (the mainnet). The assets generated in the test environment do not have value, so please be careful against the cryptocurrency fraud.
    • DeXit will announce authorization, promotion and other cooperation through its official social network, please kindly check the official information and avoid phishing sites.

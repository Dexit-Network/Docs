## DeXit Network Validator Overview

The DeXit Network is high- performance transactions, fully compatible with EVM and 
support smart contract functionality today most of the Blockchain do not incentivize 
smart contract developers for their contribution to the network
To become a validator, you need to submit a proposal first and wait for other active 
validators to vote on it, after more than half of them pass, you will be eligible to 
become a validator. Any address can stake to an address that qualifies to become a validator
DeXit Network implementation has 25+ validators with Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) 
consensus that can support short block time and lower fees. The most bonded validator
 candidates of staking will become validators and produce blocks. are responsible 
 for committing new blocks in the blockchain. These validators participate in the 
 consensus protocol by signing blocks that contain cryptographic signatures signed 
 by each validator's private key. 



Validator's rewards come from transaction fees and commission fees from delegators. 
There will be penalty for Validator depends on the severity of the violation. 
It can be Potential Loss Loss for Double-Sign Slash Running your validator 
Account keys simultaneously on two or more machines will result in Double-Sign slashing.
 Penalty for Double-Sign Slash:  Self staked will be slashed for the validator. 
 The Double-Sign Jail time is 2^63-1 seconds, which means the candidate cannot become a
  validator anymore. Note: Rewards for submitting double-sign evidence: 1M DXT Anyone
   can submit a slashing request on Dexit with the evidence of Double Sign, which should 
   contain the 2 block headers with the same height and parent block, sealed by the offending validator.
